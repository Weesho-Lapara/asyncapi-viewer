# Roadmap and evaluations

Living notes on direction. Conventions and the release procedure live in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
Dates are when a note was written; re-verify anything time-sensitive.

## Top priority: our own viewer (2.0)

Decision (2026-09-25): replace the wrapped `@asyncapi/react-component` with a viewer of our own, a
Lit web component, following [specs/viewer-spec.md](specs/viewer-spec.md). The Python side keeps its
architecture (extension first, MkDocs plugin as a thin layer); only the renderer and asset model change.

Why: a bundle around a tenth of today's 3 MB, no third-party CDN, CSP-clean, container-native
layout instead of CSS patches, dark mode, full control of the design. Cost: we maintain spec
coverage ourselves; see "Risks" below.

### Amendments to the spec

These override the imported spec where they differ:

1. **Option naming.** Do not redefine `viewer_css`. Add `viewer_theme` for the theme file and keep
   `viewer_css` as a deprecated alias that warns.
2. **Asset default.** The wheel ships the built viewer, so the default is serve-from-the-site (copied
   into the build like any static file). CDN URLs remain an option, not the default.
3. **Generated files.** `options.schema.json` and the built viewer are never committed. CI and local
   test runs execute the Node build first (`npm --prefix viewer run build`), then the Python tests.
   A `make`/script target wraps this so `pytest` alone tells you what to run if the files are missing.
4. **Escape hatch.** 2.0 keeps the 1.x renderer selectable for one major version
   (`renderer: legacy`), so a user hit by a coverage gap can flip back without downgrading.
5. **Coverage gate.** Phase 1 is not done until the normaliser has been run over the AsyncAPI
   example corpus (asyncapi/spec repository examples plus our fixtures) and the report of what lands
   in `problems[]` has been reviewed.
6. **Names.** Element `<asyncapi-viewer>`, npm package `asyncapi-viewer`, PyPI `asyncapi-viewer`
   (see "Rename" below). The spec's `<asyncapi-tag-viewer>` is superseded.
7. **CSS custom properties** use the prefix `--asyncapi-` (the spec's `--aat-` came from the old
   name). The theme file targets the `asyncapi-viewer` element. Decided 2026-09-26.
8. **Sidebar default** stays `false` in 2.0 (spec decision 2, confirmed 2026-09-26).
9. **Generated examples** (overrides spec decision 3, section 3.3 and section 7): when a message has
   no authored example, the viewer generates one from the schema so readers get a taste of real
   traffic. Values come from, in order: the field's own `examples` or `default`, the first `enum`
   value, `format` (plausible uuid, email, date-time, uri, ...), numeric bounds, then field-name
   heuristics; never bare `"string"` or `0` when a hint exists. The panel label reads
   "Generated from schema" so it is never mistaken for an authored example. Decided 2026-09-26.
10. **Anchors and focus.** The default element id is `asyncapi-viewer-N` (what the Python side
   already emits); anchors are `#<element id>--<section>--<item id>`. Section, operation, message and
   schema headings are focus targets (`tabindex="-1"`): following a sidebar link or loading a URL
   with such a hash scrolls to the heading and moves keyboard focus there. In the drawer, focus
   returns to the menu button only when it closes without a choice. Decided 2026-09-26.
11. **Sidebar as a generic list.** The sidebar renders one list of nav items
   `{ kind: 'section' | 'operation' | 'message' | 'schema', label, anchor, group?, badge?,
   search: string[] }` built once per render. Today it holds sections and operations; messages and
   schemas can be added later without touching search, grouping or the current-item highlight.
   Search (spec 4.9) is a live filter on that list: case-insensitive, the query is split on spaces
   and every term must match one of heading, channel address (with `{params}`), operation id, or
   message names and titles; results keep document order; groups with no matches disappear;
   it composes with the server selector as an intersection; empty state "No operations match";
   a polite live region says "N of M operations shown" (debounced); Escape clears the input, a
   second Escape on an empty input closes the drawer; no `<mark>` highlighting. While a query is
   active the section links (Info, Servers, Messages, Schemas) are hidden; the new option
   `searchKeepSections` (boolean, default `false`, attribute `search-keep-sections`) keeps them
   visible. Decided 2026-09-26.
12. **Host palette is opt-in.** `theme="auto"` follows only the host's light/dark state (Material's
   `data-md-color-scheme`, `html[data-theme]`, the system preference). Colours and fonts come from
   the viewer's own tokens. Matching a Material site's palette is a documented two-line override in
   the theme file (`--asyncapi-primary: var(--md-primary-fg-color)` and the font variables), not the
   default, so every site looks right without tuning. Decided 2026-09-26.
13. **Example panel layout.** The operation block is an intro (badge, heading, channel, summary,
   description, parameters) at full width, then a body with the message on the left and the
   example panel on the right, so the panel starts level with the payload tree. The two-column
   body needs the *main column* (viewer minus sidebar) to be 1100px or wider; below that the
   panel stacks under the message. Decided 2026-09-26 after review.
14. **Messages and Schemas entries are collapsible**, closed by default (native `<details>`).
   A link into either section opens the entry it targets. Decided 2026-09-26 after review.
15. **Avro schemas render as trees** (overrides spec 3.3 "Non-JSON-Schema formats become
   RawSchema" for Avro only): records, unions, arrays, maps, enums, fixed, logical types and named
   references map onto the same model, so Kafka documents get rows and generated examples.
   Protobuf and other formats stay code blocks. Decided 2026-09-26 after reviewing the Adeo document.
16. **No server selector** (overrides spec 4.6). The header dropdown only filtered operations
   for documents whose channels restrict their servers, which most documents do not. Servers are
   collapsible entries (closed by default) showing id, protocol and host in the summary, and an
   operation whose channel is restricted shows an "Available on" line linking to those servers.
   Also from the same review: no large operation heading (the badge row carries the operation
   id), channel label and address inline at one size, message ids instead of titles in the
   Message heading and example panel, the tree toolbar shows the field count and a single
   Expand all / Collapse all toggle. Decided 2026-09-26.

### Work plan in session-sized chunks

Each chunk is 1 to 3 hours, has its own acceptance check, and ends in a green CI run on the
feature branch `viewer-2` (feature flags or unused code are fine between chunks). Do them in order
unless noted. All 2.0 work stays on `viewer-2` until the release; `main` keeps receiving 1.x fixes
and is merged into the branch when needed. `ci.yml` runs on pushes to `viewer-2`; the docs deploy
stays main-only.

**Phase 0: groundwork**

| # | Chunk | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | ~~Rename to `asyncapi-viewer` (repo, packages, docs, shim for the old name).~~ Done 2026-09-26 (1.2.0). | | Old configs still work; new name on PyPI |
| 0.2 | ~~`viewer/` skeleton: Vite library mode, Lit, TypeScript, Vitest, ESLint. An empty `<asyncapi-viewer>` that renders its `src` attribute as text. `demo/index.html`. CI job: Node build, then Python tests.~~ Done 2026-09-26, plus the model types (`src/model/types.ts`), the invariants checker and hand-written expected models for both example documents, which are the design reference for 1.4 and 1.5. | 0.1 | `npm run build` yields one ESM and one IIFE file; CI green |

**Phase 1: the viewer**

| # | Chunk | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | ~~`options.schema.json` and `options.ts`: every option, kebab-case and lowercased forms, boolean rules identical to Python, one `console.warn` per bad value.~~ Done 2026-09-26. One deliberate difference: the DOM reports a bare attribute as `""`, so the viewer treats an empty boolean value as true; align the Python side in 2.1. | 0.2 | Vitest covers every option and the Python boolean table |
| 1.2 | ~~Loader: fetch as text, JSON-then-YAML parse, error model naming URL and reason.~~ Done 2026-09-26. The `yaml` package costs about 30 kB gzipped; revisit if the final bundle needs trimming. | 0.2 | Vitest with good, malformed and missing documents |
| 1.3 | ~~`$ref` resolver: internal, relative file, absolute URL, per-document cache, cycle detection producing a "Circular reference" leaf.~~ Done 2026-09-26. `preload()` fetches external documents once, then `resolve()`/`deref()` are synchronous; `$ref` chains have a cycle guard, and schema-graph cycles are left to the tree builder (1.6), which stops on a repeated resolved id. | 1.2 | Fixtures: external ref, circular ref, six-level nesting |
| 1.4 | ~~Model types and the v3 normaliser: info, servers, channels, operations, messages, reply, tags, external docs.~~ Done 2026-09-26. The normaliser reproduces the hand-written `orders-v3` model exactly; a first schema tree builder (objects, arrays, required, constraints, refName, circular leaves) came with it, composition and raw formats stay in 1.6. | 1.3 | Snapshot of `orders-v3.yaml` plus request/reply and multi-message fixtures |
| 1.5 | ~~v2 normaliser: direction mapping, labels, headings, location hints, parameters with schema, message `oneOf`.~~ Done 2026-09-26. Reproduces the hand-written `accounts-v2` model exactly; v2 security requirements are looked up in `components.securitySchemes`. Anchor slugs collapse separator runs so an item anchor never contains `--`. | 1.4 | Snapshot of `accounts-v2.json` plus parameter and oneOf fixtures |
| 1.6 | ~~Schema tree builder: required from parent arrays, type plus format, unions, `allOf` merge, `oneOf`/`anyOf` variants, constraints, enum/const/default, `RawSchema` for Avro/Protobuf.~~ Done 2026-09-26. Also tuples (`[0]`, `[1]`), `additionalProperties` as a `*` child, `patternProperties` as `/pattern/` children, boolean schemas, and a location id on every root so self-references are caught at the first hop. | 1.4 | Fixtures for each rule; Avro payload renders as raw block in the model |
| 1.7 | ~~Traits (`applyTraits`), bindings (all scopes), security, `problems[]` for skipped or suspicious input.~~ Done 2026-09-26. Merge order follows the official parser: the object's own fields win, then earlier traits over later ones; forbidden trait keys (`action`, `channel`, `messages`, `reply`, `message`, `payload`) are dropped with a problem. New warnings: v3 operation on a channel with no messages, v2 channel with neither publish nor subscribe. | 1.5, 1.6 | Trait and missing-channel fixtures; problems listed |
| 1.8a | ~~Coverage gate, part 1: script that pulls the AsyncAPI example corpus, runs the normaliser, writes a report of problems per document.~~ Done 2026-09-26: `npm run coverage` sparse-clones `examples/` from asyncapi/spec at `master` (all 3.1) and at `v2.6.0`, adds our examples and fixtures, and writes the report with counts that expose silent gaps (operation messages, payload-less and raw messages). | 1.7 | Report checked into `viewer/test/coverage/REPORT.md` |
| 1.8b | ~~Coverage gate, part 2: fix the gaps the report shows (repeat until the residue is acceptable and documented).~~ Done 2026-09-26 for the spec corpus: the one violation (root-level array schemas) was an invariants bug, fixed with a test. Residue: every remaining problem in the report comes from our own fixtures and is intentional (missing files, cycles, forbidden trait keys, bad references). The spec examples are tidy; keep adding real-world documents to the corpus as they turn up in issues, and rerun `npm run coverage` before each release. | 1.8a | Reviewed report; residue explained |
| 1.9 | ~~UI foundation: tokens, theme resolution (`auto`, Material scheme, `html[data-theme]`, media query, MutationObserver), header (logo slot rule, title, pills), Info section.~~ Done 2026-09-26. Public `--asyncapi-*` variables map to private `--_*` tokens with design defaults; the resolved mode is reflected as `resolved-theme` on the host; badge ink and text-safe accents are derived at runtime through a probe element. markdown-it adds about 46 kB gzipped (bundle now 94 kB); consider a lighter renderer in 1.18 if the budget matters. | 1.1, 1.4 | Demo shows header and Info for both docs in light and dark |
| 1.10 | ~~Operation block, part 1: badge, location hint, heading, channel row with parameter links, summary and description via markdown-it (`html: false`).~~ Done 2026-09-26, plus hash navigation (on load and on `hashchange`): an anchor inside the viewer scrolls to its block and focuses the heading. | 1.9 | Both docs render their operations |
| 1.11 | ~~Payload tree: rows, guide lines, path line from level four, expand/collapse with `aria-expanded`, toolbar, default depth, `oneOf` segmented control, constraints line.~~ Done 2026-09-26. Display rule: the `[]` item node is never a row; a primitive item folds into the parent's type (`array of string`), an object item's children become the array's children. Tree state (expansion, selected variant) lives per viewer, keyed by node path, and resets on a new `src`. | 1.6, 1.10 | Six-level and oneOf fixtures render; keyboard operable |
| 1.12 | ~~Example panel: Payload/Headers tabs, copy with live region, line numbers, multi-example select, collapsed mode, correlation id.~~ Done 2026-09-26, with the generated examples of amendment 9 (`util/example.ts`, labelled "Generated from schema") and the two-column operation layout from 1100px with a sticky panel. A failed clipboard write says "Copy failed" and announces it. | 1.10 | Examples from fixtures render; `messageExamples=false` collapses |
| 1.13 | ~~Operation block, part 2: parameters table, multi-message tabs, headers tree, reply block, bindings chips, security list.~~ Done 2026-09-26. Message tabs (arrow keys, `tabpanel`) drive both the tree and the example panel; the chips merge channel, operation and selected-message bindings with their scope prefix; reply message chips link to the Messages section (1.14). | 1.11, 1.12 | Request/reply and bindings fixtures render |
| 1.14 | ~~Remaining sections: Servers (cards, variables), Messages, Schemas (collapsible), Problems; server selector with filtering; Download spec.~~ Done 2026-09-26. Download uses an object URL over the fetched text so cross-origin documents download instead of navigating; Schemas use native `<details>`; filtering shows a status line with the hidden count. | 1.13 | Selector filters operations; download returns original bytes |
| 1.15 | ~~Sidebar and drawer: grouping modes, search, current-item highlight via IntersectionObserver, drawer with focus trap, Escape, `inert`, focus return.~~ Done 2026-09-26 on the generic nav item list of amendment 11 (`render/nav.ts`, tested). `showServers` lists server items under the Servers link only in a grouping mode. The drawer is an absolutely positioned overlay inside the viewer with a sticky panel, so it stays inside the container and still follows the viewport. | 1.14 | Keyboard walkthrough passes; grouping fixtures |
| 1.16 | ~~Container breakpoints and spacing (1100, 700), header reflow, phone tweaks; anchors `#<id>--<section>--<item>`; multiple viewers per page; late insertion.~~ Done 2026-09-26. Measured at 1280, 820 and 380: padding, heading and address sizes, pills, menu button, selector row and column counts all per spec 4.5/4.6, no horizontal overflow. Fixed on the way: the header did not wrap (title crushed at 700-1099), message cards overflowed narrow containers, the server select was uncapped beside the sidebar. Independence verified: per-element theme override, tree state and ids; an element inserted through innerHTML after load renders. | 1.15 | Three widths look right; two viewers on one page independent |
| 1.17 | ~~Accessibility and CSP: axe-core in Playwright, contrast checks, badge text colour rule, CSP test page under `script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'` in Chromium, Firefox, WebKit (write down the result).~~ Done 2026-09-26. Found and fixed: accent text derived against the page background failed 4.5:1 on toolbars and tint pills in dark mode (now derived against the toolbar colour; tint pills use ink in dark); scrolling code blocks needed `tabindex`; Lit's `styleMap` wrote a `style` attribute that a strict `style-src` blocks (derived colours now go through the CSSOM). Result written in `viewer/README.md`; Firefox runs in CI only. | 1.16 | No serious/critical axe issues; CSP page renders in all three |
| 1.18 | ~~Playwright screenshot suite (1280/820/380 × light/dark × two docs), bundle size report, final demo page.~~ Done 2026-09-26: captures six documents (anyOf, Adeo, Kraken, Gitter, orders, accounts) per browser as CI artifacts with an overflow assertion; the demo is a one-viewer test bench with a document dropdown; IIFE at 109.5 kB gzipped, markdown-it kept (46 kB) for now. | 1.17 | Suite green; gzipped IIFE size recorded in `viewer/README.md` |

**Phase 2: Python-Markdown extension**

| # | Chunk | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | ~~Emit `<asyncapi-viewer ...>` (kebab-case, escaped), validate against the copied schema, deprecations (`schemaID`, `embed_css`, unsupported `parserOptions`), `renderer: legacy` switch keeping the 1.x path.~~ Done 2026-09-26. `asyncapi_viewer/options.py` reads the schema copy made by `scripts/sync_viewer.py` (the test suite copies it itself); the element is registered as block-level; asset options default to `auto` and resolve per renderer; the docs site and the old tests pin `renderer: legacy` until Phase 3. | 1.1 | Existing tests pass with minimal updates; new tests for every option |
| 2.2 | ~~Assets: built files in the wheel, `copy_assets(dest)`, serve-from-site default, `viewer_theme` plus deprecated `viewer_css`, module vs IIFE decision written down, `RUNNER_JS` deprecation shim.~~ Done 2026-09-26. `scripts/sync_viewer.py` copies the ESM and IIFE builds, the theme and a `manifest.json` (npm version, SRI hashes) into `asyncapi_viewer/static/`; `assets.copy_assets()`, `static_path()`, `integrity()`, `cdn_url()`, `packaged()`. MkDocs plugin default: the packaged files are added as generated files under `assets/asyncapi-viewer/` with integrity attributes; the bare extension defaults to the jsDelivr copy of the packaged version with SRI (live once the npm package is published). **Module vs IIFE:** the module build is the default (`type="module"` is deferred, executes once per URL so Material's instant navigation cannot double-define the element, and CSP needs no `unsafe-inline`); the IIFE stays packaged for pages that cannot use modules. `RUNNER_JS` is not shimmed: the legacy renderer still uses it. Zensical is unverified (its build ignores plugin hooks, so it needs `viewer_js`/`viewer_theme` set by hand or `copy_assets`); check in 3.1. | 1.18, 2.1 | Wheel contains viewer; MkDocs and Zensical builds serve it locally |
| 2.3 | ~~`search_fallback`: hidden list of headings/addresses/messages for local files only (PyYAML optional dependency), removed by the viewer on render.~~ Done 2026-09-27. `asyncapi_viewer/fallback.py` reproduces the normalisers' heading and message-name rules for internal `$ref`s only (external and dangling references resolve to nothing, traits are ignored); a new extension option `file_resolver` decides what counts as a local file (working directory for the bare extension, the MkDocs files collection for the plugin). Unreadable documents warn, so `--strict` catches them; YAML without PyYAML is skipped silently. | 2.1 | Tests on and off; remote `src` never fetched at build |
| 2.4 | ~~Playwright test: a page produced by plain Python-Markdown renders both example documents.~~ Done 2026-09-27: `viewer/test/e2e/markdown/render.py` renders `page.md` with the bare extension against the Vite build served by the e2e server; `markdown.spec.ts` checks both documents, the missing-document error, the module loader and that the fallback lists are in the HTML and gone after render. Skipped locally until the page is rendered; CI renders it. | 2.2 | Test in CI |

**Phase 3: MkDocs plugin, Zensical, docs, release**

| # | Chunk | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | Plugin: local `src` existence check through the MkDocs logger, option pass-through, drop `document$` reliance; Playwright instant-navigation test on the built docs site. | 2.2 | `--strict` fails on a missing local file; instant nav test green |
| 3.2 | Docs site: demo on the new viewer with a "Customise" example, attributes (`theme`, `themeToggle`, deprecations), configuration and CSP rewrite, new Customising page, migration guide, changelog. | 3.1 | Strict build green under MkDocs and Zensical |
| 3.3 | Release pipeline: one version for npm and PyPI, Node build then wheel, SRI generation for the CDN option, retire `update-viewer.yml`. Publish 2.0.0. | 3.2 | Tag push publishes both; 2.0.0 installable |
| 3.4 | Follow-up: close issues, announce, watch for coverage reports for two weeks before removing anything legacy. | 3.3 | |

Estimate: about 35 to 45 hours of implementation across roughly 30 sessions; Phase 1 is three
quarters of it, and 1.8b is the chunk most likely to grow.

### Risks

- **Spec coverage.** The upstream component leans on the official parser for the long tail of
  real documents. Our normaliser will be right on the examples quickly and then meet unusual specs.
  Mitigations: the coverage gate (amendment 5), the Problems panel so nothing fails silently, and
  the legacy renderer switch (amendment 4).
- **Spec evolution.** CSS and the theme file are insulated: they style the internal model, not spec
  fields. Only the normaliser knows spec field names, so a new AsyncAPI minor version is a normaliser
  change and a release; a future 4.0 is a larger job, as it will be for everyone. Bindings render as
  generic chips, so new binding fields appear without code changes.
- **Maintenance surface.** A Node toolchain, Playwright in three browsers and a two-registry release
  join the repo. Keep chunks small and CI green so the surface stays manageable.

## Rename to asyncapi-viewer (done 2026-09-26, release 1.2.0)

The fenced-block syntax made "tag" a misnomer; the new viewer makes the name wrong twice. Target
names, all checked free on 2026-09-25: PyPI `asyncapi-viewer`, npm `asyncapi-viewer`, GitHub
`Weesho-Lapara/asyncapi-viewer`, import package `asyncapi_viewer`, MkDocs plugin id
`asyncapi-viewer`, Markdown extension `asyncapi_viewer`, authoring element `<asyncapi-viewer>`.

Compatibility kept for one major version: plugin id `asyncapi-tag`, extension name `asyncapi_tag`,
element `<asyncapi-tag>`, and a PyPI shim `asyncapi-tag` depending on `asyncapi-viewer`. The fence
language `asyncapi` does not change. The old `asyncapi-tag` PyPI project can be archived once 1.2.0 is out.

## Later ideas (after 2.0)

- Build-time validation of local documents through the normaliser (Node) or a light JSON/YAML check.
- Config-level default attributes in `mkdocs.yml`.
- Server-side rendering of the model to static HTML for no-JavaScript readers and search indexing.
- Sphinx adapter; Docusaurus adapter (evaluation below).

## Docusaurus support (evaluated 2026-09-25, parked)

Decision: not pursued for now. A working prototype exists under [prototypes/docusaurus/](prototypes/docusaurus/).
Once the new viewer exists as a web component, a Docusaurus adapter shrinks to a remark plugin that
emits the element; the React wrapper in the prototype becomes unnecessary.

What was learned:

- **Same syntax works.** A ~60-line remark plugin rewrites ```` ```asyncapi ```` fences and
  `<asyncapi-tag>` elements into a JSX node and injects the import, so `.md` and `.mdx` both work.
- **Do not bundle `@asyncapi/react-component` through webpack.** Its parser depends on Node core
  modules that webpack 5 no longer polyfills; the build fails out of the box. Loading a prebuilt
  bundle at runtime avoids that. Moot once our own viewer ships without the parser.
- **Wrap in `BrowserOnly`**; the viewer must not run during server-side rendering.
- **Paths are simpler than MkDocs**: `static/` is served at the site root and `useBaseUrl` handles
  the base path.

## Ecosystem notes

- **Zensical** (0.0.65) ignores `plugins:` silently but honours `markdown_extensions:` and rewrites
  relative `data-asyncapi-src` values per page itself. That is why `mkdocs.yml` lists both forms.
  Build-time "document not found" warnings are MkDocs-only.
- **MkDocs 2.0** (`2.0.dev6` on PyPI) removes the plugin system according to the Material team. The
  Markdown-extension design is the hedge; `compat.yml` runs the suite against the pre-release weekly.
- **The current viewer** (`@asyncapi/react-component`) sizes itself with container queries. Below
  roughly 1024px of container width it uses a compact layout with `position: fixed` controls and a
  non-shrinking centre panel; `EMBED_CSS` neutralises that. Goes away with 2.0.
- **Material `navigation.instant`** re-executes content scripts after swapping the page; the 1.x
  runner also subscribes to `document$`. Custom element upgrades make this unnecessary in 2.0.
